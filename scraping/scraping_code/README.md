# Problem Statement and Motivation

## Problem Statement 
Build an app that - 
1. Allows viewing and downloading papers and discussion from OpenReview
2. Runs offline
3. Supports math, code and markdown notes
4. Allows the user to favourite notes
5. Supports reading lists - currently reading, already read and wishlist for papers

## Motivation

During RnD, we need to read a lot of papers and take notes for future reads.

A note taking app which allows the user to use Math, Code and Markdown facilities is very useful while reading research papers.
An offline app for such a cause will prove to be very useful.
